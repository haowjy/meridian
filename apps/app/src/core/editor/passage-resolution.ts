/**
 * Where a searched passage is in the document *now* — the honest half of a
 * search-match door.
 *
 * A search result names a block and the term that matched it. Between the
 * search and the click the writer may have edited, moved or deleted that
 * block, so arriving means re-deciding, against live text, whether the promise
 * can still be kept. Three outcomes, and no fourth: the passage is where it
 * said, the passage is somewhere unambiguous, or we say it changed. Landing on
 * a nearby-but-wrong paragraph is the failure this module exists to refuse.
 *
 * Pure over a ProseMirror document: no editor, no Yjs, no timing.
 *
 * The searchable projection is the delicate part. It must find exactly what the
 * server's search would find, and nothing the writer did not write: text either
 * side of a line break or an image is not one word, and case folding is not
 * length-preserving in every language.
