/**
 * One mechanism for every menu the writer types underneath, reading a spec.
 *
 * `/` and `[[` are the same machine with different envelopes: a plugin key, a
 * store in extension storage, a `@tiptap/suggestion` lifecycle, arrow keys
 * registered against the chrome kernel, and a plugin view that closes the menu
 * when the host's catalog is withdrawn. None of that is where the lanes differ,
 * and all of it is where the failures live — first-keystroke keymap timing,
 * catalog withdrawal, dismissal, plugin lifetime. So it exists once here, and a
 * lane declares only its own answers: what opens it, where it may open, what
 * matched, how the rows read, and what a choice writes.
 *
 * A lane is one call to `createSuggestionLane`. Adding a trigger adds a spec,
 * the same way adding a closer adds a row to
 * [`../auto-pair/auto-pairs.ts`](../auto-pair/auto-pairs.ts) and adding a
 * selectable object adds a row to
 * [`../../objects/object-types.ts`](../../objects/object-types.ts).
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does NOT do, for every lane at once:
 *
 * - **Own Escape.** The chrome kernel does (`escStep`), and it runs first at
 *   priority 1050; a menu takes its step by being a registered layer, which the
 *   React surface does when it opens. Suggestion's own Escape handling stays as
 *   the floor under that, for the frame before React has rendered.
 * - **Gate on transaction origin.** `shouldShow` is evaluated on every
 *   transaction, so using it to keep remote writes from opening a menu would
 *   also close an open menu every time a collaborator typed anywhere in the
 *   chapter. A lane's own predicate already needs the local caret.
 *
 * One thing it inherits rather than decides: a dismissal stays dismissed. The
 * suggestion plugin maps the dismissed range forward, so a second trigger typed
 * against a dismissed one is the same trigger — the menu comes back when the
 * trigger text is deleted, not when it is repeated.
