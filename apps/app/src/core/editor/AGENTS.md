# core/editor — Collaborative editor runtime

This directory owns the browser-side TipTap schema, Yjs document sessions, and
editor-only projections. It is the app boundary for collaborative manuscript
editing; it does not own server persistence or trail authority.

## Mental model

One collaborative editor binds to one shared Yjs document fragment through the
`DocumentSessionRegistry`. Live peer marks are ephemeral projections of durable
change-trail events, not manuscript content.

## Key rules

- Assemble collaborative extensions only through `createEditorExtensions()` and
  keep the app schema aligned with `@meridian/prosemirror-schema`.
- Keep a single Yjs fragment and sync path per editor, and let
  `mounted-editor.ts` be the only thing that can end an editor's life: a
  rebuild destroys the Yjs UndoManager and drops keystrokes in flight.
  `EditorMountIdentity` carries every construction fact, `editorMountKey()`
  turns it into the React key that owns the mount, and `useMountedEditor()`
  constructs and destroys TipTap itself so the schema-repair witness can
  synchronously bracket every extension lifecycle mutation. Anything a caller
  can change while the writer keeps typing is `EditorSurfaceOptions` and
  reaches the running instance; projection data arrives through stores the
  extensions subscribe to (`SessionMarkerStore`, `AgentNameStore`). A new
  construction knob belongs in the identity type — never in an effect
  dependency list.
- Schema repair is observed and reported, never fenced. Keep the pre-bind
  snapshot, single update listener, and atomic open-to-live phase transition
  together in `schema-repair-witness.ts`; do not add a second listener or move
  construction back behind TipTap's deferred `useEditor` lifecycle.
- Do not persist, branch-project, or locally author peer marks. Resolve
  awareness cursor colors to concrete RGB before publication.
