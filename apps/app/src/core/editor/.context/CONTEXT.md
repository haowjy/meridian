# App editor — TipTap/Yjs runtime contract

The app editor builds the browser-side TipTap schema and binds it to the shared
Yjs document session. It must stay structurally aligned with
`@meridian/prosemirror-schema`; schema drift corrupts y-prosemirror documents.

## Contracts

- `createEditorExtensions()` is the only app-side extension assembly point for
  collaborative documents, and its TipTap schema must stay structurally equal to
  `buildDocumentSchema()`. The two are built separately and parity is not
  enforced, so a node or attr added on either side is a two-file change.
- Collaboration uses the shared `PROSEMIRROR_FRAGMENT_NAME` Y.XmlFragment. Do
  not create a second fragment name or a second editor sync path.
- `DocumentSessionRegistry` is keyed by the Yjs room key, not by editor surface:
  live rooms use the bare document id; review rooms use the opaque,
  generation-fenced `reviewRoomName` vended by the preview. Switching live ↔
  review is a session identity change and must remount the TipTap editor because
  Collaboration binds to a concrete Y.Doc/fragment at construction. A review
  mount requires both `reviewDraftId` and `reviewRoomName`; neither selects the
  live surface, while either one alone is invalid and must fail rather than
  falling back to live.
- `mounted-editor.ts` is the editor-lifetime boundary, and the split it draws is
  the contract:
  - `EditorMountIdentity` is a discriminated union over the two surfaces (live
    room, optionally detached, versus a generation-fenced review room) plus the
    construction facts both share: document, project, schema type, and whether
    CollaborationCaret is installed. Every field changes which extensions exist
    or which shared document backs them, so `editorMountKey()` renders it into
    the React key that owns the mount, and `editorRoomKey()` names the room the
    session registry must supply. Callers derive both from the same identity, so
    a session swap cannot arrive without a new mount.
  - `useMountedEditor()` freezes construction on first render and calls
    `useEditor` with no dependency array. TipTap 3 then reconciles changed
    options onto the live instance with `setOptions()`; the extension array's
    identity is stable, so its option comparison finds nothing to do on an
    ordinary re-render.
  - `EditorSurfaceOptions` (editability and ProseMirror `editorProps`) is
    everything that may change mid-mount. Editability needs its own
    `setEditable()` call because TipTap's option sync deliberately re-asserts
    the running editable flag. A caller that rebuilds `editorProps` every render
    pays an extra `view.setProps` — never a rebuild — so editor handlers do not
    have to be identity-stable; they read live editability off `view.editable`
    rather than closing over props.
  - `EditorView.lifetime.test.tsx` is the enforcement: it proves a thread-query
    refetch and a live surface change keep the same editor and UndoManager while
    a room change replaces them.
- Live sessions may use versioned IndexedDB persistence. Review sessions do not:
  the branch room is server-persisted and generation-fenced, and a local cache
  risks recovering state into the wrong review generation.
- Live peer marks are the session projection of durable trail changes. Their
  anchored popover lazy-reads trail detail and the originating thread snapshot.
  The popover is evidence and navigation only; producing-turn receipt Undo/Redo
  is the sole reversal authority for AI changes.
- Peer-mark manuscript color describes the change, not the thread identity:
  added/modified marks use jade and deletions use crimson. Ordinary ranges rest
  as an underline only; a sweep is the sole resting warning tint. Per-thread
  hues belong only to identity chrome such as the hover label and popover dot.
  Localized mark and trail verbs come from `change-mark-labels.ts`; do not
  duplicate English labels in the ProseMirror extension or UI surfaces.
  The thread name inside a mark label arrives through `AgentNameStore`, a
  subscribable lookup the projection repaints from. It is a store rather than a
  resolver callback because the editor is built once per room: a closure over
  the thread-list query would re-key the editor on every refetch, and thread
  titles land after the turn that created the mark. An untitled thread
  contributes no name, so the label falls back to "AI".
- Live `DocumentSession`s own an ephemeral `SessionMarkerStore` sidecar.
  Change-event replace sets survive editor remounts during the registry's
  retention window but are never persisted or projected into branch rooms.
  Every accepted replace set advances its group revision before changes admitted
  by the current writer are filtered, so an all-self set still clears older
  marks and fences delayed replays. Unresolved anchors expire on their own timer
  even while the editor is idle; store teardown cancels that timer.
  The ProseMirror projection clears a whole mark only for a local writer edit
  through its range or tick; remote sync, selection, and boundary-adjacent typing
  never clear it.
- Deletion marks are caret-sized inline ticks. A boundary anchor resolves into
  the first or last descendant textblock on its affinity side, falling back to
  the opposite adjacent container; never leave the widget between block nodes
  as an anonymous line. Deletions use crimson for their tick and focus ring.
- Collaboration awareness is a browser protocol boundary: theme-owned cursor
  colors must be resolved before publication and serialized as concrete
  six-digit RGB hex. CSS variables and OKLCH strings are valid token sources,
  not valid y-prosemirror awareness colors.
- Live sessions may be created `detached`: their Y.Doc and IndexedDB persistence
  exist before server transport. Ordinary acquisition of an existing detached
  room leaves it detached; post-create reconciliation explicitly attaches
  transport to that same session once. Retention accepts an explicit detached
  room set so restored pending tabs create local sessions without probing a
  server row that does not exist yet. If an older client already left that room
  terminally denied, post-create reconciliation restarts it before attachment.
  Teardown always preserves IndexedDB by
  default because it may contain the only copy of unsynced words; only confirmed
  cleanup paths may request persistence deletion. Retention and unavailable-room
  recovery must not materialize or replace a detached session implicitly.
- A schema fence is orthogonal session state, not a connection status:
  `DocumentSessionSnapshot.schemaFence` composes with detached, synced, offline,
  and access-lost states. The first fence wins, is persisted through the
  version-keyed localStorage quarantine producer, and remains observable for the
  session lifetime; it never changes `deriveStatus()`. A quarantine loaded
  before attachment keeps the room detached. Raising a fence on an attached
  session pauses editing and presence but does not itself detach transport.
  Storage failure leaves the in-memory fence effective but not durable.
- A `4406 client-schema-superseded` reset gets one silent reload before the
  session raises `client-superseded`. The sessionStorage guard is keyed by room
  and the schema `major.minor` tag, is written before `location.reload()`, and
  clears only after first transport sync. IndexedDB persistence and localStorage
  quarantine use the same tag: patch releases reuse them, while a minor or major
  change partitions them. A blocked guard or repeated refusal raises the fence
  without another reload. `4407 document-schema-stale` never reloads or raises
  a fence because a new bundle cannot repair a server/head major mismatch.
- TipTap extensions may provide editing behavior, but they must not add node or
  mark types outside the shared schema unless the schema package and server
  markdown adapter are updated in the same change.
- Inserted images are inline `image` nodes wrapped in their own paragraph. Their
  `src` is a stable `asset:<documentId>`; `ImageNodeView` resolves a signed read
  URL through `asset-image-render-state.ts`, while the markup codec materializes
  project-relative paths. One failed media load may refresh the signed URL
  automatically; the next one surfaces an error instead of looping.
- Assets cross the clipboard as project-relative paths and live inside the
  editor as stable refs. `image-workflow.ts` owns both directions, and the
  resolver behind them is per-editor because a path only means something inside
  one project's asset namespace.
- Block alignment lives as an `align` attr on `paragraph`, `heading`, and
  `table`, mirroring `@meridian/markup`'s reserved `Layout` wire wrapper. Only
  `null`, `"center"`, and `"right"` exist; there is no `"left"` ghost state
  because unaligned is the default. Table alignment renders twice — through the
  node's `renderHTML` and through `MeridianTableView`, because the resize plugin
  takes over table DOM once `resizable` is on.
- `table-operations.ts` owns the table transforms prosemirror-tables omits (row
  and column moves, whole-column alignment, layout reset). All of them refuse a
  table containing spans, because GFM cannot represent one and the codec throws
  on serialization. Row zero is the structural GFM header and never moves.
- Slash commands use TipTap Suggestion and activate only when `/` starts an
  otherwise-empty paragraph outside table cells. The catalog and its localized
  labels come from the mounting surface, never from the extension.
- Clipboard HTML is rebuilt, not scrubbed: `sanitize-paste.ts` copies allowed
  elements into a fresh document with an attribute allowlist, so a
  newly-supported browser attribute is unsafe by default. `createEditorConfig`
  composes it *after* any caller `transformPastedHTML` so a caller can never
  reintroduce markup the schema would accept.
- Editable link clicks place a cursor instead of navigating: `openOnClick` is
  off and a plugin calls `preventDefault()` while still letting ProseMirror
  resolve the selection. `link-url.ts` is the single normalizer for
  writer-entered targets (http/https/mailto only).

## TipTap v3 defaults we intentionally disable

- `trailingNode: false` — TipTap v3's StarterKit can append a trailing paragraph
  after terminal blocks. In this Yjs-backed editor that would be a real shared
  document mutation on open/sync, not visual chrome. Keep trailing-space UX as an
  explicit editor feature if needed, not an inherited StarterKit default.
- `undoRedo: false` — collaborative history is not TipTap local history.
- `link`, `underline`, `listKeymap` and built-in camelCase schema extensions are
  disabled where Meridian installs custom schema-parity wrappers.

## Draft review — projection-only view extension

Colocated under `extensions/inline-review/`. The extension is a ProseMirror
plugin that owns a single `DecorationSet` describing every hunk in the current
server review model. Keep this directory view-only: plugin state, decorations,
commands, and the lightweight hunk model used by the plugin.

- Only installed when the editor is bound to a review branch room. The
  `enableDraftInlineReview` flag on `createEditorExtensions` follows the
  `review` variant of `EditorMountIdentity`, which needs both a draft id and its
  generation-fenced room name; live editors never pay for it.
- The plugin is the sole owner of decoration state. React talks to it via TipTap
  commands (`setInlineReviewModel`, `setInlineReviewActiveOperation`,
  `scrollInlineReviewOperationIntoView`) — never by holding decoration objects.
- Anchor resolution routes through the shared `relative-position-runtime.ts`
  extraction of the y-prosemirror binding (`ySyncPluginKey` state).
  `Y.RelativePosition` decode is separated from
  decoration construction so anchor handling can be unit-tested without a DOM.
- Remote Yjs sync and a new model from `useInlineReviewSync` re-resolve
  RelativePositions; local writer typing maps the existing set through the
  transaction. The extension has no optimistic attribution path — the next
  server model owns writer attribution. Review dispositions never use browser
  mutation origins or collaborative history; Ctrl+Z is not a review restore
  mechanism.
- Editor-side click seam: mousedown on any decoration DOM
  (`[data-review-operations]`) dispatches
  `setInlineReviewActiveOperation` for the first listed operation. This is
  the editor→sidebar direction of bidirectional linking; the sidebar
  reads plugin state via `useEditorState` and reacts (scroll card into
  view + emphasise). Pure deletions use an empty, visible navigation seam with
  focused-operation emphasis; its DOM contains no manuscript text.

Attribution → highlight color (agent = jade, writer = gold), review palette
lives in `packages/design-tokens/src/ink-jade.css` under `--color-review-*`.

The plugin paints **one decoration per `ReviewHunk.spans` entry** rather
than one per hunk, so nested authorship (a writer edit inside an AI
insertion) renders in each owner's own color — gold inside green. Hunks with no
resolvable spans fall back to whole-hunk coloring via `hunkKind`.

## Change-trail navigation

`change-trail-navigation.ts` is the authorize/open/sync/validate boundary for
historical trail clicks. It temporarily retains the target `DocumentSession`
until the synced Y.Doc anchor has passed `@meridian/agent-edit`'s item-ID block
validation and the mounted live editor accepts the range. The always-installed
`LiveRangeNavigationExtension` owns the temporary decoration and scrolling;
zero-width deletion anchors render a caret-like boundary rather than inventing
a replacement range. Chat supplies route resolution, but must not decode,
validate, or map anchors itself.

## Search-passage navigation

`passage-navigation.ts` is the retain/sync/resolve boundary for search-match
doors. Its anchor is a block hash plus the term that matched, not an encoded
position: the hash derives from the block's immutable Yjs item id, so it
survives every edit inside the block and dangles only when the block goes.

Opening is **not** part of it. A search row is a document door first; the route
change happens either way, and this only decides where inside the document to
land. Ownership of that decision advances at the project route's door boundary
(`features/project/chat/usePassageDoors.ts`), which every door reports to,
passage or not — a resolution the writer has clicked past must not arrive
behind them. Three outcomes, produced by `passage-resolution.ts` against live
ProseMirror text:

1. the hash names a live block and the term is still in it — mark its
   occurrences there;
2. the block is gone, or no longer holds the term, and the term occurs exactly
   once in the document — mark that;
3. otherwise `stale`, which surfaces as a notice
   (`passage-notice-store.ts`). Never a landing chosen among duplicates: taking
   a novelist to a nearby-but-wrong paragraph is worse than saying nothing was
   found.

The notice's lifetime is store-owned and token-scoped, never the rendering
component's. A notice is about a navigation, and navigations continue while its
document is off screen; leaving expiry to the component stranded it, so
returning to that document later replayed a forgotten complaint.

The searchable projection is where honesty is won or lost. Text runs break at
every non-text inline leaf, so `gate` and `keeper` either side of a hard break
can never read as the unique `gatekeeper` step 2 is allowed to jump to. Each
run then folds as one string, the way the server folds: case is contextual, and
`"ΟΣ"` lowercases to `"ος"` whole but `"οσ"` letter by letter, which both misses
the searched word and matches a different one. Every folded unit still carries
the source range behind it, because `"İ".toLowerCase()` is longer than its
source.

`PassageHighlightExtension` owns the mark and the reveal. It is **never a
selection** — the writer's cursor may be elsewhere mid-sentence — it scrolls
center-biased only when the passage is not already on screen, and it clears on
the writer's next edit or caret move. Remote Yjs transactions (`ySyncPluginKey`
meta) do not clear it: they arrive constantly and would wipe the mark before it
was read.

## Selective Discard (dock Changes cards)

Each card's **Discard** is a server disposition command for its authoritative
Discard class. It never edits the review Y.Doc from the browser. The review
session's synchronous disposition lock serializes commands, and the awaited
preview refetch replaces the projection and decorations before the lock releases.

## Math extension decision

Meridian keeps the custom `math_display` node. Do not enable
`@tiptap/extension-mathematics` directly: TipTap v3 adds `blockMath` and
`inlineMath`, which are not in the shared markdown-safe schema.
