/**
 * mounted-editor — the sole authority over a collaborative editor's lifetime.
 *
 * Collaboration binds to one concrete Y.Doc fragment at construction, so
 * rebuilding a TipTap editor destroys its Yjs UndoManager and drops keystrokes
 * in flight. That rule is enforced structurally here rather than by convention:
 *
 * - `EditorMountIdentity` holds every fact TipTap can only learn at
 *   construction, and `editorMountKey()` turns it into the React key that owns
 *   the mount. A remount is therefore a key decision at one boundary.
 * - Everything that may change while the writer keeps typing arrives as
 *   `EditorSurfaceOptions` and reaches the running editor through TipTap's own
 *   `setOptions` sync (plus `setEditable`, which that sync deliberately skips).
