# core/completion — the headless half of a menu the writer types underneath

The open-menu store every trigger publishes through, and the catalog that ranks
the documents a `[[…]]` may name. Two hosts drive it: the editor's lane
mechanism
([`../editor/extensions/suggestion/`](../editor/extensions/suggestion/suggestion-lane.ts))
and, next, the chat composer's textarea. Neither one is visible from here.

## Mental model

**Nothing here knows what is rendering it.** No ProseMirror, no DOM, no React,
no writer-facing string. `anchorRect` is the single piece of geometry a menu
carries and the host supplies it as a callback, so the same store serves a
ProseMirror rect and a caret-mirror measurement without learning which it got.
The placement argument, drawn from the real dependency graph, is the module
header in [`index.ts`](index.ts).

**A trigger owns its envelope; this owns the menu.** Where a trigger may open,
what a choice writes, and how a row looks all belong to the host. What arrives
here is a session: stable row identity, rows, the query, a label, and the two
callbacks that take a choice or a dismissal. The lifecycle issues stable
session/generation identities; a host advances the generation before async work,
and stale updates or closes are refused rather than published by arrival order.
Query/context/container updates reset selection by explicit caller policy, while
a same-session refresh can preserve the active stable row ID. The store's own
judgment remains narrow — a menu is open only while it has rows, the highlight
sits on the first row the host will accept, and a row the host refuses is stepped
over rather than handed a key that does nothing.

**Transitions are serialized events.** An accepted open, update, or close first
installs its captured snapshot, then calls its lifecycle callback, then notifies
menu subscribers. A synchronous reentrant transition waits in the lifecycle's
FIFO until that event is complete, while still returning its reserved identity
or acceptance immediately. Close consumes the full session/generation ticket;
session ID alone never proves ownership.

**Interactions describe actions, not host policy.** One `SuggestionHost` lease
registers ordinary ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Home, End, Enter, and Tab bindings plus
semantic retreat (`backtrack`, then root `dismiss`). The shared menu owns edge
movement and Enter-versus-Tab choice intent, while each host places retreat in
its own Escape precedence. Releasing the lease tears down both halves once.

**The catalog offers what the resolver can find.** Rows rank titles and aliases
because that is what `POST …/links/resolve` matches on, and names normalize the
way the server normalizes them. A host that offers a document the resolver has no
candidate for hands the writer a link that lands dashed the instant it is
inserted; the host's job is to offer the manuscript and the work's scratch, which
is the resolver's own candidate set.

**Ambiguity is shown, not resolved.** Two documents with one title resolve to
nothing, so a row whose name is shared says so and is still offered. Renaming one
of them is the writer's fix, and the menu never guesses which they meant.

## Key rules

- **No import from `editor/`, `features/`, or a rendering library.** A completion
  that needs the editor belongs in the editor's lane, not here. The reverse
  direction is fine and expected.
- **Host callbacks, never host state.** Lifecycle `open`/`update`/`close`, row
  `choose`, `dismiss`, and `anchorRect` are read live; the store holds no copy of a document, a catalog, or a rect.
- **A withdrawn session closes rather than freezes.** Hosts can lose their
  catalog mid-menu (a schema fence, a read-only surface), and `close()` is the
  one door for it.
- **The create row is a row, not a footer**, because the keyboard has to reach
  it, and it steps aside for an exact match: naming a document that already
  exists is how a writer makes their own link ambiguous.

## Anti-patterns

- Growing the snapshot with something only one surface renders. That is `TMeta`,
  or it is the host's own state.
- A second title-matching rule anywhere. Two ranking implementations is two
  menus that disagree about one query, and one of them disagrees with the
  resolver.
