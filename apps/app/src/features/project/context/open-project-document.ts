/**
 * Opening a project document by id — the app's one answer to "take me there".
 *
 * A document id is all a door carries: a change trail's receipt, a search
 * result, a wikilink the writer just followed. Turning that id into an open
 * tab means finding which scheme's tree holds it, and that lookup plus the
 * openTab-and-route pair is the same work every door was about to write for
 * itself.
 *
 * Two dispositions, because a writer who asked for a new tab did not ask to
 * leave the sentence they are in: `current` moves the pane to the document,
 * and `background` opens it on the tab strip and stays put. There is no
 * browser-tab disposition — the manuscript is a live collaborative session,
 * and a second window on it costs the writer their place to reach a document
 * that was already one tab away.
