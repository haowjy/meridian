/**
 * Pure, i18n-aware helpers for curated tool-result rows and bounded preview
 * text. Owns only display formatting.
 *
 * One parser per payload the timeline knows how to read. Each stops at its own
 * cap, which is what lets a closed row ask "is there anything behind this
 * chevron?" without paying for the whole list, and each answers that question
 * with the same code that fills the expand, so the two can't disagree.
 *
 * **The caller picks the parser, because the caller knows the tool.** A search
 * hit and a listing entry are both `{uri, …}` objects, and guessing which one a
 * payload holds by looking at its first recognizable entry throws away every
 * later row that disagrees with the guess. Tool identity selects the parser;
 * the row's own discriminant then selects how it renders.
 *
 * Rows say what they *are* rather than carrying a string the renderer has to
 * sniff: a document's name is a door, a folder's name is not, and only the
 * parser knows which it just read.
 *
 * Snippets arrive as the model saw them, which for manuscript documents means
 * a leading block hash. Hashes are how the model addresses a block; they are
 * not words, and the writer never sees one. This is the seam where a tool
 * payload becomes a line of the writer's book.
