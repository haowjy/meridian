# features/chat — Activity/Thinking composition model

How an assistant turn renders: the relationship between the collapsed **`Thinking`**
(process) disclosure and the visible **`ActivityBlock`** (delivery frontier), across the
whole turn lifecycle. This is the implemented contract for the turn render surface.

## Two zones

- **Process fold** — default-collapsed history: every reasoning/thinking block,
  every earlier activity run, and every frontier tool operation once the turn
  reaches a durable terminal status. If the fold contains tools, its visible
  label is their deterministic digest; otherwise it reads `Thinking`.
- **`ActivityBlock`** — the live delivery frontier. For a settled turn it keeps
  only non-tool frontier blocks (text, image, custom, including resolved
  interrupt cards). A tools-only settled frontier is empty.

The zones are rendered by `ProcessDisclosure.tsx` (fold) and `AssistantTurn.tsx`
(the visible zone, driving `DeliverySegments` → `groupDeliverySegments`).

## Partition rule

**Step 1 — segment at interrupts.** Split ordered `Block[]` at each interrupt;
the interrupt is the final block of its segment.

**Step 2 — group maximal runs** within each segment:

- **reasoning** = `reasoning` | `thinking`
- **activity** = everything else

Earlier activity runs and all reasoning runs go into the fold. The last activity
run is the frontier.

**Step 3 — apply durable settlement.** For live statuses (`pending`, `streaming`,
`waiting_interrupt`), the frontier stays whole and visible. For settled statuses
(`complete`, `cancelled`, `error`), tool protocol blocks from the frontier move
into that segment's fold in chronological position; frontier non-tool blocks
remain visible.

The settlement input is the canonical `isTerminalTurnStatus` result. Partition
never reads transient component liveness, partial-block shape, or stream buffers.
A turn's final settled frame and its reload therefore partition identically.

## Lifecycle table

Notation: `r` = reasoning, `p` = prose/custom/image, `t` = tool operation,
`[fold]` = collapsed process disclosure.

| durable state | blocks | visible `ActivityBlock` | process fold |
|---|---|---|---|
| live reasoning | `r0` | empty | `r0` (`Thinking`) |
| live first run | `r0 · p1 t2 p3` | `p1 t2 p3` | `r0` (`Thinking`) |
| live later reasoning | `r0 · p1 t2 · r3` | `p1 t2` | `r0, r3` (`Thinking`) |
| live new frontier | `r0 · p1 t2 · r3 · t4 p5` | `t4 p5` | `r0, (p1 t2), r3` (`Explored…`/outcome digest) |
| settled | same blocks | `p5` | `r0, (p1 t2), r3, t4` (digest includes all tools) |
| settled tools-only frontier | `r0 · t1` | empty | `r0, t1` (digest) |

The live roll-up rule is unchanged: a new activity run moves the previous
frontier into the fold. Settlement adds one final structural move for tool rows
only. Prose and interaction cards do not become process history merely because
the turn ended.

### Digest contract

The label summarizes only ToolViews actually inside that segment's fold. Reads
with document targets contribute unique explored documents; successful writes
contribute edited/drafted documents; invoke, unknown, failed, and otherwise
uncountable operations contribute steps. Clauses are ordered explore → edit →
steps. The accessible name remains `Thinking` / `Thinking part N` regardless of
the visible digest.

## Interrupts segment the turn

A **interrupt** (user-interaction / HITL block — a `custom` block resolved via
`onRespondToInterrupt` in `CustomBlockRenderer.tsx`) is a **segment boundary**. It is the
*final block of its segment* and the **frontier** of that segment's `ActivityBlock` (the
round is waiting on the user).

After the user responds, the interrupt card stays expanded and the continuation
opens a fresh fold/frontier pair below. While the turn remains live, that earlier
segment's frontier stays whole. When the turn settles, its tool rows fold just
like every other segment's; the interrupt card and other non-tool blocks remain
visible.

A turn renders as a **vertical stack of `(Thinking + ActivityBlock)` segments**,
one per interrupt round. There can be **multiple visible `ActivityBlock`s** (one per
segment) — not just one.

### Worked example (interrupt round)

Before the user responds — one segment, interrupt `c7` is the frontier:

```
> Thinking                                    (collapsed)
| [0] reasoning
| ActivityBlock([1] text, [2] tool, [3] text)
| [4] reasoning
ActivityBlock([5] text, [6] tool, [7] interrupt ← awaiting user)
```

After the user responds, segment 2 begins below. Once the turn settles:

```
> Explored 1 document                         (collapsed, segment 1)
| [0] reasoning
| ActivityBlock([1] text, [2] tool, [3] text)
| [4] reasoning
| [6] tool
ActivityBlock([5] text, [7] interrupt)             ← interaction stays visible

> Thinking                                    (collapsed, segment 2)
| [8] reasoning
ActivityBlock(… segment 2's frontier …)
```

Each segment applies the same durable-settlement rule independently.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Process fold / `Thinking` disclosure** | The default-collapsed disclosure rendered by `ProcessDisclosure.tsx`. Holds reasoning, completed activity runs, and settled frontier tool rows. Its visible label is a tool digest when possible. |
| **`ActivityBlock` (delivery frontier)** | The live last activity run; after settlement, its non-tool blocks only. Rendered by `AssistantTurn.tsx` → `DeliverySegments`. |
| **Activity run** | A maximal contiguous run of activity blocks (non-reasoning). The last one in a segment is the visible frontier. |
| **Segment** | A subdivision of the turn at interrupt boundaries. Each segment has its own `Thinking` + `ActivityBlock` pair. |
| **Interrupt boundary** | A `custom` block that partitions segments. It is the final block of its segment. |
| **Roll-up** | When a new activity run begins, the previous frontier collapses into `Thinking` in its chronological position. |

## Contracts & invariants

### Invariants

- **Default-collapsed everywhere.** `Thinking` disclosures are closed by default whether
  streaming live or settled/reloaded. No `defaultOpen={reasoningStreaming}`.
- **Durable status is the lifecycle seam.** Terminal status folds every segment's
  tool rows. Transient `isLive` and partial-block state never drive partitioning.
- **Interrupt cards stay visible.** Resolution freezes the segment boundary; on
  settle, its tool rows fold but its resolved interrupt card remains visible.
- **Block render keys are positional.** `blockRenderKey` derives from
  `(turnId, sequence)`, never `block.id`. Updates within one render zone preserve
  DOM identity. Settlement keeps frontier prose, images, and custom/interrupt
  cards in place, so they do not remount. Tool views alone structurally move from
  the frontier into the process fold and may remount at that boundary.

### What breaks if violated

- Keying the partition off transient streaming state → the final frame and reload
  can disagree.
- Folding a resolved interrupt card → the user loses sight of what they acted on.
- Keying by `block.id` → ordinary within-zone updates can remount DOM nodes,
  losing animation continuity and scroll position.

Current code path:

                                           ← interrupt segmentation, run grouping,
                                             and terminal tool folding

          → sibling ToolRows | DeliveryBlock
              → CustomBlockRenderer (interrupts)
```

`tool-renderers.tsx` is the registry for tool-name-specific presentation. Registry
keys must be real runtime tool names from
`apps/server/server/domains/runtime/tools/`. The current runtime surface is
`write`, `ls`, `grep`, `invoke`, `ask_user`, `spawn`, and `return_result`;
`ask_user` renders through component cards, while `spawn` and `return_result`
intentionally use the humanized default renderer.
Three conventions govern all renderers:

- **Unknown tools show a humanized name only.** The default renderer displays
  the tool name with underscores replaced by spaces and its first letter
  capitalized — never arguments or paths. Tool arguments are developer detail
  that should not appear in the writer's chat surface.
- **`toolVerb()` for status-aware tense.** Every registered renderer uses
  `toolVerb(tool, completedNode, activeNode)` to conjugate the action label
  by `tool.status` (`complete` vs `partial`). This keeps verb presentation
  consistent and prevents missing-tense bugs when adding new tools.
- **Curated expand content.** Inline expansions render result rows, stream tails,
  or plain output — never raw JSON. If raw JSON is needed for debugging, it goes
  behind a dev-only setting.

Neutral tools (`write`, `ls`, `grep`, `invoke`) get explicit titles/icons and
may expose `streamOrOutput` or result rows without implying any external
execution substrate. Adding a renderer is a presentation change only: append
the real runtime tool name to the `RENDERERS` map and keep protocol pairing in
`group-delivery-segments.ts`.

Key files:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `AssistantTurn.tsx` | Top-level turn render; drives partition + zone mounting |
| `partition-turn-segments.ts` | Structural interrupt segmentation + run grouping for Thinking/Activity zones |
| `group-delivery-segments.ts` | Pairs adjacent tool protocol blocks into ToolViews, then emits single-tool or tool-run segments |
| `ProcessDisclosure.tsx` | Collapsible `Thinking` disclosure with sticky user-toggle state |
| `CustomBlockRenderer.tsx` | Renders `custom` blocks; interrupts pass through `onRespondToInterrupt` |
| `tool-renderers.tsx` | Tool renderer registry; unknown tools show name only, registered tools use `toolVerb()` for tense and may show curated expand content |
| `AssistantTurn.tsx` (`DeliverySegments`) | Renders adjacent ToolViews as sibling `ToolRow`s |
| `TurnBlockStep.tsx` | Compact label/body row for reasoning/prose/image fallback blocks; tools are handled upstream |
| `block-render-key.ts` | Positional render keys — `turnId::sequence` |
| `block-kind.ts` | Block type predicates (`isToolDeliveryBlock`, `isImageBlock`) |
| `@meridian/contracts` → `threads/index.ts` | `Block`, `BlockType`, `Turn` types |

### Block types (`BlockType` from `@meridian/contracts`)

| BlockType | Kind | Rendered by |
|---|---|---|
| `reasoning`, `thinking` | reasoning run | `TurnBlockStep` (in fold); italic prose in `Markdown variant="compact"` |
| `text` | activity run | `Markdown variant="answer"` (settled) / `StreamingText` (partial) |
| `tool_use`, `tool_result` | activity run | Paired into ToolViews by `groupDeliverySegments`, then rendered as sibling `ToolRow`s by `DeliverySegments` |
| `image` | activity run | `ImageBlock` |
| `custom` | activity run (incl. interrupts) | `CustomBlockRenderer` → component registry |

## Implementation status

Implemented in `partition-turn-segments.ts`, `ProcessDisclosure.tsx`, and
`AssistantTurn.tsx`. The partition returns interrupt-bounded segments where
`foldRuns` contains reasoning, earlier activity runs, and — for settled turns —
the frontier's tool protocol blocks. `frontier` contains the complete last
activity run while live and only its non-tool blocks after settlement.
`ProcessDisclosure` is a default-collapsed shell; callers compose reasoning rows
and folded activity runs.

## Turn edits card (`TurnEditsCard.tsx`)

The existing per-turn Changes view below each assistant turn that edited
documents: a default-collapsed card
whose header names a single document or counts multiple documents, followed by
settled `+added −removed words` totals when the trail shell has them. Live
single-document headers derive the same URI title without inventing a delta.
The shell carries this header metadata so collapse never triggers a detail fetch.
Expanding shows
the per-document list and authorized durable change-trail rows. Created files count like any edit (creation flows
through the same agent-edit write path and produces mutation rows). Rows come
from turn lineage in BOTH scopes (`live` + `draft` via `useTurnLiveLineage`),
while historical row evidence comes from the authorized trail reader. Undo is
guarded by the canonical receipt state. Sweep and resurrection rows carry only
forward human actions (`Restore` / `Delete again`), idempotent by `changeId`.
Captured bodies remain visible after document loss and reload; an unavailable
live root degrades to Copy. There is no ChangeTrail transcript
card or finishing presentation. INVARIANT: no draft Review/Apply/Discard here;
pending changes belong to the composer-attached `DraftDock`.

**Server-owned receipt and card contract.** `AssistantTurn` combines two
server-owned facts: turn lineage supplies document scope and the durable receipt
supplies whole-turn Undo/Redo authority; the settled trail supplies historical
document titles, word totals, and protected change rows. Both direct and draft
lineage may produce this same card. A draft proposal with neither lineage
documents nor trail documents produces no card; after Apply, its committed
receipt correctly reads `Edited`.

The single Undo/Redo chip calls the turn-scoped reverse endpoint. Receipt state
(`live-active`, `branch-active`, reversed, dependent, or expired) decides whether
that control is available; the client does not synthesize transcript turns or
invent local receipt state. Draft Review/Apply/Discard remain exclusively in the
composer-attached `DraftDock` and inline review surface.

## Related (separate but adjacent)

- **Default-tool renderer + arg streaming** — DONE. `groupDeliverySegments` normalizes
  live merged tools and durable `tool_use`+`tool_result` pairs into ToolViews before
  rendering. The three-tier tool model (default → registered → generative) remains broader scope.
- **catchup-fidelity** — DONE. Guarantees settled turns reconstruct the same `Block[]`
  from the durable snapshot. This model relies on that guarantee.
- **AI draft review UX** — DONE. Surfaces share one server-backed draft state:
  the composer-attached `DraftDock` (work-scoped, the single actionable strip for
  pending changes), the dock `Changes` view (`DockChangesView`, document groups +
  per-op rows for the reviewed document), and the editor's `DraftReviewHeader`
  (full-width review chrome: Back to live / Apply all / Discard all). All consume
  `DraftReviewProvider` from the project shell. Client review-session state has
  one owner: `useDraftReviewController` + `draft-review-controller-transitions.ts`.
  That session owns active inline selection, stale-draft handling,
  and — for the dock Changes cards' per-card Apply/Discard — closure/discard
  confirmations, inline messages, discard timers, and the inline discard journal
  cache (`inline-review-discard-operation.ts`). Editor-side code only adapts runtime
  inputs: `useInlineReviewSync` pushes/reports plugin models; the dock cards drive
  the manuscript through `controller.focusReviewOperation` and settle changes
  through `controller.acceptOperation` / `controller.discardOperation`. See the
  [requirements doc](../../../../../../../.meridian/git/haowjy-meridian-flow-docs/work/human-undo-affordance/requirements.md)
  for design decisions and the
  [draft review lifecycle decision](../../../../../../../.meridian/git/haowjy-meridian-flow-docs/kb/decisions/draft-review-lifecycle.md)
  for architecture.

## Composer placeholder rotation

`placeholders.ts` owns per-page-load rotating prompts for the chat composer.
Each pool (`COMPOSE_PLACEHOLDERS`, `INTERJECT_PLACEHOLDERS`) is an array of
Lingui `msg` descriptors — locale-live but structurally pure. On module load,
`selectPagePlaceholders()` advances the localStorage index by one and freezes
the selection for the lifetime of the page. Components re-render without
consuming another entry.

SSR safety: `useSyncExternalStore` returns the first pool descriptor as the
server snapshot and the rotated descriptor as the client snapshot. Locale
resolution happens inside the hook (`i18n._(descriptor)`), after selection,
so hydration shape is descriptor identity (stable) rather than resolved string
(locale-dependent).

Rotation is Composer-internal. The `placeholder` prop overrides the rotating
default when set (the hero variant uses this path). The deferred mention-hint
intent is tracked in [`.context/TODO.md`](TODO.md), with no dormant production
machinery.

## Composer field-sizing pitfall

The base `Textarea` component applies `field-sizing-content` via Tailwind.
Composer needs `field-sizing: fixed` so its JS auto-resize controls height.
The override uses an **inline style** (`style={{ fieldSizing: "fixed" }}`),
not a class, because `tailwind-merge` does not deduplicate `field-sizing-*`
utilities — adding `field-sizing-fixed` alongside `field-sizing-content`
leaves both in the class list and the last-in-source wins, which is
non-deterministic after merge. Inline style is the reliable override.

## Change-trail row suppression

`ChangeViewRows` returns `null` (hiding all per-operation rows for a document)
when every change in the trail is `kind: "insert"` without `writerProtection`.
The card itself (`TurnEditsCard`) still renders — it carries the document line
and whole-turn Undo. This is the pragmatic subset of
[#321](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow/issues/321): purely generative
inserts produce no detail rows. Mixed turns or any protected change restore the
full row list. Per-row filtering within mixed trails remains with #321.

## Don't

- Don't branch on transient `isLive` or partial-block state in partition logic;
  only the canonical durable terminal-status flag belongs at that seam.
- Don't key blocks by `block.id` — use `blockRenderKey` (`turnId::sequence`).
- Don't roll interrupt segments into a later segment's `Thinking` — they are frozen.
- Don't auto-open `Thinking` disclosures during streaming — default-collapsed everywhere.
- Don't duplicate tool rendering logic between the fold and the activity zone —
  `DeliverySegments` handles tools for folded activity runs and visible frontiers via
  ToolViews; raw tool blocks must not reach `TurnBlockStep`.

## Draft review freshness

`DraftReviewProvider` owns the client cache freshness contract for mounted inline
reviews. When an inline review has a mounted draft `DocumentSession`, any Yjs
update in that draft room invalidates both:

- the active draft preview query, so the editor rail/hunks re-derive from the
  latest server review model; and
- the work draft list query, so the composer dock reflects updated draft counts
  without closing and reopening review.

This subscription is a freshness seam only. The TipTap/Yjs session remains the
single document-sync path; the provider never interprets update contents or builds
a second draft model.

Accept paths gate on a fresh `draftRevisionToken` taken from the preview fetch,
never from client Yjs sync state — the server token is the authority on what the
writer actually reviewed.

## The pending signal and draft-only tab lifecycle

**One pending signal.** `pendingReviewDraft(group, nowMs)` in
`docked-drafts.ts` is THE per-document "has changes to review" derivation
(newest active draft that carries review content). The dock's pending rows,
the identity bar's `DraftReviewChip` (self-contained; hides itself during
that document's inline review so it never coexists with
`DraftReviewHeader`), and the Draft→Auto-apply switch count
(`pendingDockedDraftCount`) all derive from it. Never grow a second
is-pending derivation; surfaces that disagree about pending state was a
shipped bug class (dock said none, mode-switch dialog said one).

**Draft-only tabs.** A NEW document proposed by a draft is real (documents
row + Yjs state) but absent from the live tree until accept. Its review tab
is synthesized by the launcher (`context-tab-from-draft.ts`) and marked
`draftOnly`, from the server's `isNewDocument` flag — derived per list
request from manifest membership (in the work manifest, not the live one),
never stored. The marker's lifecycle is event-based via
`resolveDraftOnlyTab(projectId, documentId, "committed" | "discarded")`:

- Every accept path (whole-draft AND per-card, which materializes a new
  document on the first partial apply) resolves `"committed"` — keep the
  tab, drop the marker — and must do so BEFORE the workDrafts refetch lands,
  because draft-group absence alone cannot distinguish accept from discard.
- Whole-draft reject resolves `"discarded"` — close the tab. The provider's
  disappearance effect also resolves `"discarded"` unconditionally: it is
  only ever reached for discard exhaustion, since accepts cleared the marker
  first (the server list never returns terminal drafts, so there is no
  terminal evidence to disambiguate with).
- `openTab`'s metadata merge deliberately never clears the marker (absent
  keys don't override); `saveLastContextRoute` skips draftOnly tabs so a
  discarded path can't replay on the next visit; `ContextPaneController`
  repairs the route when a lifecycle resolve removes the route-active tab.

Server-side twin: rejecting a new-document draft also removes its entry from
the work manifest branch — otherwise the next accept in that work pushes the
dead entry to live and the discarded document resurrects as an empty file
(caught by a runtime probe; regression test in
`collab-domain.reverse-turn.db.test.ts`).
