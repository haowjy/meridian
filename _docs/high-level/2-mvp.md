# Meridian: MVP Specification

**What We're Building and How**

---

## MVP Goal

**Validate:** Does AI with full project context help fiction writers maintain story consistency?

**How:** 10 writers use it for 2 weeks, 3+ say "I want to keep using this"

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks to testable product

---

## What We're Building

### Core Experience

```
Writer opens Meridian
├── Sees document tree (left)
├── Edits document (center)
└── Chats with AI (right)

Writer creates documents:
├── Characters/Elara
├── Locations/The Capital
└── Chapters/Chapter 1

Writer writes in Chapter 1:
"Elara walked through the capital..."

Writer asks AI:
"Is this scene consistent with Elara's character?"

AI automatically:
├── Reads Chapter 1 (current document)
├── Full-text search for "Elara" across all documents
├── Loads Characters/Elara document
├── Loads any other docs mentioning Elara
└── Responds with full context

Writer: "This is magical."
```

**That's the MVP.**

---

## The Three Core Systems

### 1. File Management

**What users see:**
- Document tree (folders + documents)
- Click document → opens in editor (single view, one document at a time)
- Create/rename/delete/move documents
- Rich text editing (bold, italic, headings, lists)
- Auto-save (every 2 seconds after typing stops)
- Word count

**MVP simplification:**
- Single document view (no tabs)
- Clicking new document saves current and loads new one
- Keeps MVP focused and simple
- Tabs can be added in Phase 1.5 if needed

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Store TipTap JSON (for editor)
- Generate Markdown (for AI + search)
- Full-text search index
- Document metadata (created, modified, word count)

### 2. AI Context Building

**What users see:**
- Type naturally in any document
- Ask AI questions in chat
- AI responds with knowledge of entire project
- Optional: Context panel showing what AI loaded

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- User asks question in context of current document
- **Simple approach:** Full-text search for key terms from question + current document
- Load top N matching documents
- Build prompt with: skill + current doc + matched docs
- Stream response

**Context discovery for MVP:**
- Full-text search (Postgres `to_tsvector`)
- Search current document + question for important terms
- Rank by relevance (TF-IDF or simple scoring)
- Load top 5-10 documents
- Total context budget: ~50-100K tokens

**Optional future:** 
- RAG with embeddings
- Better entity extraction
- Semantic search
- But full-text search is enough to validate

### 3. Persistent Streaming

**What users see:**
- Send message to AI
- See response stream in
- Can close browser
- Come back later
- Response completed or still generating

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Create stream session in Go
- Launch goroutine for AI call
- Cache chunks to Redis
- Save to database when complete
- Reconnection pulls from cache + continues

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: File System (Week 1-2) ✅ Backend Complete | 🚧 Frontend In Progress

**Backend:** ✅ All Complete
- ✅ Go + Fiber server setup
- ✅ Supabase connection (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Document CRUD endpoints
- ✅ Store both TipTap JSON and Markdown
- ✅ Full-text search indexing
- ✅ Deploy to Railway

**Frontend:** 🚧 In Active Development
- ✅ Next.js + TypeScript setup
- ✅ TipTap editor integration
- ✅ Document tree component
- ✅ Auto-save implementation
- ✅ API client for backend
- ❌ Deploy to Vercel (pending)

**Deliverable:** ✅ Backend: Can create, organize, and edit documents. Frontend in progress.

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Week 3-4) 🚧 Backend Partial | ❌ Frontend Not Started

**Backend:** 🚧 Partially Complete
- ✅ Multi-provider AI interface (LLMProvider abstraction)
- ✅ Provider registry system
- ✅ Claude provider implementation (Anthropic)
- ✅ Chat CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Turn tree structure with branching support
- ✅ JSONB content blocks (text, thinking, tool_use, references)
- ✅ Request parameters (temperature, thinking, top-k, model)
- ❌ OpenAI provider implementation
- ❌ Google Gemini provider implementation
- ❌ Simple context builder (full-text search integration)
- ❌ Streaming endpoint (SSE) - **Next: Task 5**

**Frontend:** ❌ Not Started
- ❌ Chat panel component
- ❌ Provider selector
- ❌ Skill selector
- ❌ Message display
- ❌ SSE streaming client

**Current Status:** Backend chat system is fully functional with synchronous LLM calls. Streaming infrastructure (goroutines + SSE) is next priority (Task 5).

**Deliverable:** 🚧 Backend works with blocking LLM calls. Frontend chat UI pending.

**Test:** 
- Write about "Elara" in one document
- Create Characters/Elara document
- Ask AI about Elara
- Verify AI loaded Characters/Elara via search

### Phase 3: Persistent Streaming (Week 4-5) ❌ Not Started

**Backend:** ❌ Not Started
- ❌ Stream manager with goroutines
- ❌ Redis caching for chunks
- ❌ Session management
- ❌ Reconnection logic
- ❌ Cleanup on completion

**Frontend:** ❌ Not Started
- ❌ Store session IDs
- ❌ Reconnection handling
- ❌ Resume from cache
- ❌ Show stream status

**Deliverable:** Streams persist server-side, reconnection works.

**Note:** This depends on Phase 2 streaming (Task 5) being complete first.

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 5-6)

**Focus areas:**
- Performance tuning
- UX polish (loading states, errors, confirmations)
- Search relevance tuning
- Bug fixes
- Edge cases

**Deliverable:** Polished, reliable product ready for beta.

### Phase 5: Beta Testing (Week 7-8)

- 5 writers from Royal Road
- Real usage for 2 weeks
- Daily feedback
- Iterate on critical issues
- Make launch decision

## Technical Decisions

### Context Building: Start Simple

**MVP approach:**
```
User asks: "Is Elara's dialogue consistent?"

1. Extract key terms: "Elara", "dialogue", "consistent"
2. Full-text search across all documents
3. Rank by relevance (how often terms appear)
4. Load top 5-10 documents
5. Add current document
6. Send all to AI
```

**Why this works:**
- Fast (Postgres full-text search is quick)
- Simple to implement
- Good enough for validation
- Can improve later

**Future improvements:**
- RAG with embeddings (semantic search)
- Better term extraction
- Learning from usage patterns
- But don't need these for MVP

### Why Store Both TipTap JSON and Markdown?

**TipTap JSON:**
- Editor needs it to render
- Preserves formatting

**Markdown:**
- Cleaner for AI
- Better for search
- Easy to export

**Generate Markdown automatically on save.**

### Why Go for Backend?

Persistent streaming needs goroutines. Go makes it simple. Python needs Celery + workers + complexity.

## Data Models

### Document
```
id: UUID
project_id: UUID
path: string (e.g., "Characters/Elara")
content_tiptap: text (TipTap JSON)
content_markdown: text (generated from TipTap)
word_count: int
created_at: timestamp
updated_at: timestamp
```

### Project
```
id: UUID
user_id: UUID
name: string
created_at: timestamp
```

### Stream Session (Redis)
```
session_id: string
user_id: string

## API Endpoints

### Documents & Tree
```
GET    /api/projects/:projectId/tree
POST   /api/documents
